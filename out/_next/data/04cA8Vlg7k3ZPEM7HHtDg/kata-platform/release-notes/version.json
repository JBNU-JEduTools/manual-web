Here’s what’s new:\n\n- Prediction Logs data now shows predicted labels, prediction score, plus the date and time it was predicted.\n- You can now search and filter your Prediction Logs data by entities, training status, prediction score, and date.\n- We added a new **Ignore** feature, so you can train your NL model to, _well_, ignore sentences that don’t belong to any label. This allows your NL model to learn and improve its algorithm, ultimately improving the accuracy of your NL model.\n\n<ImageWrapper>\n  <FigureImage\n    src=\"/assets/images/products/kata-platform/release-notes/platform-3.4.0/nl-insight.webp\"\n    alt=\"NL Insight Illustration\"\n    layout=\"responsive\"\n    naturalWidth={2560}\n    naturalHeight={1500}\n  />\n</ImageWrapper>\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed FAQ table cannot show more than 10 labels\n- Fixed error when adding/deleting questions in FAQ table\n- Fixed bot revision history only show last 10 snapshots\n- Fixed error when accessing NL Studio\n\n<br />\n## 3.3.0\n\nIn this release, we're highlighting our newest feature and some recent updates to Kata Platform.\n\n<ImageWrapper>\n  <FigureImage\n    src=\"/assets/images/products/kata-platform/release-notes/platform-3.3.0/module.webp\"\n    alt=\"Module Illustration\"\n    layout=\"responsive\"\n    naturalWidth={1100}\n    naturalHeight={612}\n  />\n</ImageWrapper>\n\n### Modules\n\nModules are prebuilt bot features, ready to be integrated into your project in just a few clicks. This way, you can create amazing conversational experiences even faster. In this beta-release, we're introducing modules for two of the most common chatbot features: FAQ and Location.\n\n#### FAQ Module\n\nFAQ Module lets your chatbot answer questions your customers often ask. It's excellent for anyone who wants to reduce the workload of their customer service department. With this module, you can build the knowledge-base to handle the repetitive questions, so your live agents can focus on more complex problems.\n\n#### Location Module\n\nLocation Module lets your users find the nearest location of your business. This module is ideal for any industries offering face-to-face customer experiences, such as banking and retail. Your users can share their location, and you can point them to your nearest establishments along with the Google Maps directions.\n\nAll of our modules are already integrated with CMS Studio. It means anyone on your team can collaborate on managing the content without the need for programming or technical skills. Further details and documentation about Modules can be found [here](https://docs.kata.ai/modules/introduction/).\n\n### Misc\n\n- Fixed \\n causing errors in Method.\n- Emulator now lets you test each environment separately.\n- Emulator now lets you test CMS content.\n- Added emulator on client dashboard. Now your client can test changes they made directly on the dashboard.\n\nAs always, we're happy to chat with you to learn more about your use cases and feedback on Kata Platform. You can send us your thoughts via email to [support@kata.ai](mailto:support@kata.ai) or join our community on [Slack](http://bit.ly/JoinTemanKata).\n\n<br />\n## 3.2.2\n\n### Bot Studio improvements\n\n- We've added the Quickreply and Confirm Template action templates, compatible for LINE Messenger.\n- Buttons can now be used to trigger a date/time picker.\n- Added the option to add Phrase NLU output for NLU entities with type Phrase.\n\n### Deprecated NLU Types\n\nOn the Bot Studio NLU selector, we have deprecated NLU types `Verstand classifier`, `Verstand tagger` and `Verstand retrieval`. New NLUs created can no longer have these types.\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- **Bot Studio:** Fixed incorrect KataML generated when creating CMS action.\n- **Bot Studio:** Fixed issue where onEnter mapping is stringified.\n- **NL Studio:** Fixed unable to inherit NLU.\n- **NL Studio:** Fixed searching inherit and root NLU.\n- **NL Studio:** Fixed various display issues with training + prediction log.\n\n<br />\n## 3.2.0\n\n### Super Model\n\nSuper Model is a highly maintained pre-built entity for Users to use without training. New projects would automatically have a Kata Entity, named `kata`, for tagging common task like person name, location, datetime, email, number, etc. For more details, [click here](/nl-studio/super-model/).\n\n### Channel improvements\n\nAdded support for WhatsApp channel. You can now enter your WhatsApp channel details in the platform.\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- **Bot Studio:** Fixed unable to update state in end state.\n- **NL Studio:** Fixed missing field dictionary for entity type.\n- **NL Studio:** NL settings now show the correct defined NLU language.\n- **Bot Studio:** Fixed bug where some form errors were not shown correctly.\n- **Bot Studio:** Fixed bug where the flows editor does not reflect the updates made in self-transition state.\n\n<br />\n## 3.1.0\n\n### Bot Studio Improvements\n\n- Added \"CMS\" action. Now you can search/select CMS elements when creating action on Bot Studio.\n- Bot Studio now auto-saves your work as a draft.\n- CMS Studio now allows you to invite non-Kata Platform users to use Kata Dashboard.\n\n### kata-cli\n\nKata-CLI now shows bulk training status:\n\n- Information if there is any active training job.\n- Error on specific training data.\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- Fixed an issue that caused \"Add Mapping\" button to disappear after users click Single Mapping when creating method.\n- Fixed an issue that caused users unable to search public NL when creating entity.\n- Fixed an issue that caused display on keywords field to not expand when users add more than 1 lines.\n- Fixed some display bugs.\n- Fixed crash when creating transition & intent.\n- **kata-cli:** Fixed a bug showing incorrect bot latest revision on Bot Studio after users push bot on Kata-CLI.\n- **kata-cli:** Fixed data training order when users use bulk training feature. Now use last-in-first-out method.\n\n<br />\n## 3.0.0\n\n**Kata Platform 3.0** is our biggest update yet. In this version, we are introducing several new features to help you build a more comprehensive solution for your needs.\n\n### What's New\n\n#### Projects\n\nManage your chatbot project under one roof. A project consists of one bot design, one NL, and one CMS. Each of them will have different versions you can maintain.\n\n<ImageWrapper>\n  <FigureImage\n    src=\"/assets/images/products/kata-platform/release-notes/platform-3.0/kata-platform-3-0.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Projects Image\"\n    layout=\"responsive\"\n    naturalWidth={2560}\n    naturalHeight={1500}\n  />\n</ImageWrapper>\n\n#### CMS Studio\n\nBuild your own CMS for your chatbot. Your client will have a full access to maintain the knowledge or content of your chatbot. Now you can build your own CMS based on your needs.\n\n<ImageWrapper>\n  <FigureImage\n    src=\"/assets/images/products/kata-platform/release-notes/platform-3.0/cms-studio.webp\"\n    alt=\"CMS Studio\"\n    layout=\"responsive\"\n    naturalWidth={3358}\n    naturalHeight={1844}\n  />\n</ImageWrapper>\n\nOnce you've done building your own dashboard, you can invite users or clients to contribute to the dashboard and update your bot's knowledge easily. All in all, your dashboard will look like this:\n\n<ImageWrapper>\n  <FigureImage\n    src=\"/assets/images/products/kata-platform/release-notes/platform-3.0/dashboard.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Dashboard\"\n    layout=\"responsive\"\n    naturalWidth={2880}\n    naturalHeight={1500}\n  />\n</ImageWrapper>\n\n#### NL Prediction API\n\nBuild your own Natural Language using our NL Studio, and use it everywhere.\nNow it supports:\n\n- Entity Recognition\n- Intent Classification\n- Sentiment Analysis\n\n#### Kata Design Language System\n\n##### Aksara\n\nAksara is our very own design language system. It contains foundations, voice and tone guidelines, component standards, and other guidelines that systematically improve quality, timeliness, and consistency to our product.\n\n##### Wicara\n\nPreviously known as kata-kit, Wicara is the implementation of Aksara Design Language using React framework. It is designed to be flexible and reusable react components.\n\nGo to http://aksara.kata.ai to see our Design Language System.\n\nWe hope Kata Platform 3.0 will help you build smarter chatbots in shorter development time. It is our mission to democratize AI and help the community to build chatbot solution.
