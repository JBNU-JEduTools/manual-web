### Analytics

A feature to analyze end-users behavior. This data analysis set can be used to enhance conversational AI product quality.

### Condition

Condition is a way to control executions for bot elements (read: transitions, states, actions and intents). This condition is using Javascript code. Here is an example in KataML.

<FigureImage

  alt="Condition example in action."
  naturalHeight={789}
  naturalWidth={1600}
/>

### Flow

Flow is a feature to create bot flow, integrate bot with NLU and create data mapping for bot needs. A flow corresponds to a discourse in a conversation.

<FigureImage

  alt="How flow works."
  naturalHeight={724}
  naturalWidth={1502}
/>

A flow consists of intents, states, and actions. In Kata Platform, the processing of end-user message is divided into three pipelined steps:

1.  **Intent recognition** which converting raw message into structured information (in form of intent and attributes)
2.  **State mapping** which determining the state of the bot and the context variables
3.  **Choosing action** to generate response by executing defined action

<FigureImage

  alt="Chatbot message flow."
  naturalHeight={238}
  naturalWidth={1564}
/>

You can think the Intent - State - Action separation as an MVC model, where the intents are the controller, the states as the model and the actions as the views.

A chatbot can have multiple flows and those can be active at the same time. Those information is stored in the **flow stack**.

- If any new input arrive, the chatbot will search for a flow.
- The chatbot stores which flow is the current flow (read: whenever a flow is opened, it will become the current flow). Hence, current flow will be preferred.
- Then, the chatbot will look for a matching intent to remove a flow from the stack.
- It will push the previously current flow to the stack.
- Then, previous flows in the stack are on hold.

Here is the illustration.

  alt="Flow stack."

In Kata ML, a flow consists of following definitions:

- `intents` : `Dict<Intent>` means intent definitions.
- `states` : `Dict<State>` means state definitions.
- `actions` : `Dict<Action>` means action definitions.
- `methods` : `Dict<string>` means flow-specific method definitions.

Additionally a flow can be set as following:

- `active` : `boolean` means you can enable/disable a flow by setting the active field of a flow.
- `volatile` : `boolean` means you can set as true to close the flow whenever it goes outside the flow.
- `expire` : `number` means it will set flow to expire after specified number of miliseconds.

### NLU

Natural Language Understanding is a capability that a computer possesses to transform a text message into a structured object. In the Kata Platform, NLU is a place for users to design and build their NLU capability for their conversational AI product.

### NLUs

NLUs is a feature which enables you to integrate chatbot using keyword and regex. Also, NLUs enables you to add NLU model in your chatbot.

### Channels

A channel is an instant messaging application that can be integrated with Kata Platform, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, LINE, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, etc.

### Deploy

Deploy is a feature in the Kata Platform to do Deployment which merges all Revisions in Revision List.

### Deployment

Deployment is a step to merge all Revisions in Flow, NLU, and CMS so that bots can be integrated into the channel. Before starting channel integration, chatbots must at least have 1 deployment.

### Environment

An environment is a zone in computer science that provides a place to run integrated applications. Kata Platform has 3 environments: development, staging, and production.

### Project

Project is a feature to start your bot or NLP project. A Project can consist of Flow, NLU, and CMS.

### Publish

Publish is a command button to save changes in bot and NLU.

### Result

Few action types return result that can be used in the next action. Here is an example for API action that trigger a HTTP call.

  alt="result usage in API action."

### Revision List

Revision List is a feature to list available revisions. In Kata Platform, we adopt semantic versioning (semver) for the bot versioning scheme. You can have multiple versions of a bot and you will be able to revert back to any previous versions. You can also tag a version with a specific label.

### Variables

Variables can be accessed in action options using $() notation. Following variables are available:

- `content` means message content.
- `payload` means message payload.
- `type` means message type.
- `metadata` means message metadata.
- `intent` means message intent.
- `attributes` means message attributes.
- `result` means result from API call.
